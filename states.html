		<li>Alaska</li>
		<p>This website does not fit the device it is being used on. I like the colors, and I like how when I hover over the mountains othe things pop up. It is fairly easy to navigate, and it contains a lot of useful information. It does look boring though. It deserves an overall score of a 5/10.
