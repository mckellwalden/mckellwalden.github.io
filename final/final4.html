	<p>When I was little I went to France to visit my cousins. We went to Paris for a week. We went to the top of the Eiffil Tower and took some cute family pictures. We also went to the Louve and looked at all the beautfil art. When I went again this summer we also went to Versallies. I had very never been there before, but it was somehwere I have always wanted to go. The actual palace was sooo beautiful. It definetly exceeded my expectations. Th gardens on the other hand were very cool and large, but they looked a lot different in pictures. It was pretty, but different. We spent a whole day at the Louve and it was not as cool as I remember when I was little. We had barely any time at the Eiffil Tower. We did not go up it, we just walked under it and then walked around it and took pictures. I would have loved to spend more time there.</p>
