			<p>This summer I got to go on a trip of a lifetime. I went to five countries in Euope with 50 of by best frineds from high school, and I got to go to Kenya with my mom. With my classmates, we went to Germnay, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and France over 16 days. Overall we got a little snipit of the beauty of Euope, so when we et older and go on a vacation there, we would know what some places are like. I had been to France and Switzerland when I was little, because my cousins lived outside of Paris. My parents wanted to make it a vacation, so we went to Paris and Lucerne Switzerland. Both places were beautuful and I always wanted to go back when I got older. This trip was perfect. We worked with an organization called EF Educational Tours. We learned a lot about the history of every city where we went. We had multiple tour guides from each area and we had one overall guide who we all fell in love with named Johnny.</p> 

			<p>After all my friends left from the Paris Airport, my mom flew in. The next day we flew to Nairobi Kenya. We were in Kenya for 18 days. Each day we wwent of safaris and got to see the beautiful animals in the famous national parks. We went there with my moms friend from college and her two kids who were around my age. </p>
			
			<p>I have been so fortunite to be able to travel as much as I have. I have seen the world through so many lenses and it has made me more of a globel citizen. I urge everyone to travel outside of the US and see how different countries do different things. It is so cool to see how other people live and see how different other cultures are. </p>
