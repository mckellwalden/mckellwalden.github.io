<p>Kenya is a place I will never forget. I also never thought I would go to Kenya or anywhere in Africa. We always think of Africa as starving kids, and people without clean water, and all of these horrible things, but it is also an extrodinary place. A day there was so busy. We would wake up at 5 am, be on our truck by 5:30 am. We would go on our morning drives and eat breakfast on the road. During this time we would see these beaufiful animals that were wild, not in zoos. We would go back to camp around 2 pm, eat lunch, have a break then get back on the trucks at 4 pm. Our night drives would end around 7 or 8 pm. We would have a sun downer which is where we would have a beer and watch the animals and talk. After, we would go back to camp and have dinner, take a shower, then hopefully be asleep by 9 or 10 pm to start the day over in the morning.</p>
<p>We were in Kenya for so long, but every day was so different and so special. Everytime I look back, I always wanna go back. We visited 5-6 national parks. My favorite was either the Meru which was this tiny little very secluded park. Not very many people go there. But I remember when we landed from our tiny plane there, the "airport's" bathroom was the worst bathroom I have been in. When I went to the bathroom mosquitos came out of the toilet bowl, so when I got there I was not impressed and wanted to go home. WHen we got to the actual camp it was beautiful. It was built inot the side of a mountain and was so cute. We all had our own cottages. The wildlife here was so special because it was our first everything. We spotted our first elephants...who are my favorites... and I found these month one lion cubs on our way out. My second favorite place was the Massi Mara. It is known for all of the cats. When we were their we saw over 50 different lions. We saw a cheetah and a leopard. My all time favoite place was in Nairobi Kenya, which is the capital of Kenya. It was the Sheldrick Orphanage which is where we got to spend time playing with baby elephants. It was so fun and I honestly would go back to Africa just to do that again.</p>
