	<p>I have never been to Italy before, but I was very excited. We were going to Verona and Venice. We did not spend much time in Verona, but I loved it. It was so beautiful and had lots of history. We spent a full day on the island of Venice. When we rode the boat in I was so excited because everyone dreams of going there. Venice is also the nuber one place for pitpocketing so we all had to carry as little as possible, and keep track of our belongings. It was so crowded. I hated it at first. There were so many people and I was not enjoying it. I felt trapped and it felt like there was nothing to do on the island also. After a little while, my friends and I decided to go ina random direction and get lost. We ended up finding this really cute and inexpensive pizza place. There was like 20 of us and we all eat for less than $10. We wondered the less crowded streets of Venice and I started to really like it. We took some cute pictures and got to see the pretty arch ways and water ways. We found some shops and bought some Italian noodles and other souveniours. At the end of the day, Venice was different and I am happy to say that I hvae been there. I would not want to go back for more than a day though, but I would have loved to go back.</p>
	<p>Another funny story in Italy is the hotel. It was by far the worst hotel we stayed at. The water was brown, no wifi, and our door would not lock very well. We were there for three nights. We also did not eat as a group Venice which I thought was really weird. We ate at the hotel instead.</p>
