	<p>Johnny our tour guide is from Berlin Germany, so we were in his home country. We first went to a place called Rothenburg. It was a cute little city that was mainly for tourism. They had a full wall surrounding the city. We got their late, so a lot of shops were closed, but we did find a little gelato place. The next day we went to othercute town called Schwangau. The castle that Beaty and the Beast is replicated after this castle. We got a tour and took lots of beautiful photos with the castle behind us. The next couple days we spent in Munich. Munich was my favorite place on our trip. We went to the BMW manufracture, went to the old kings summer home, and got a tour of the beautuful architecture that Hilter wanted in his capital city. We had lots of free time. We walked into a beer garden where there were thousands of people enjoying a drink with their friends and family.</p> 
	<p>Before I came on this trip, I graduated high school. My favorite uncle is an aloholic but he told me a story when he was younger and came to Munich and drank lots of beer at the Hofbrahaus. He gave me $100 as a graduation gift, and he told me to spend it on a beer and cheers to him at the Hofbrahaus. Well I really wanted to make this happen, but we were not allowed to drink without a chaperone with us, if it was not dinner. Well the boys and I on the trip had to kind of cheat to make this happen. We got our beers and had 10 minutes to drink a liter of beer before we had to meet with the rest of the group. I totally plan on going back to Munich and spending more time where in the future with my friends and family.</p>
