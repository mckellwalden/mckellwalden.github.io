<h1>Good!</h1>
 <a href="http://feedmusic.com" title="Feed Music">Feed Music</a>
	<p>I like this website but it is a lot. The design is really cool and very interactive, but it kind of gives me a headache when I look at it because its always moving. When you scroll it moves with you, but the image always moves not the page. It is really trippy and really cool. I have never seen a website be so interective and have the images move when you scroll rather than have the page move. It looks clean and modern. I recognize some of the things they are using like links, scripts, href, src, rel, head, body, lists, etc. They also are using meta properties and I do not think we have learned about that. They also did the font thing where you take fonts from another website and use them in here. I do not see any table elements. The layout makes sense. There are lots of lists and links to other html pages or websites or pictures. There is a scrollig effect and it is trippy. It is pretty eay to navigate. You basically scroll a lot and then they have a taab in the right corner to see other things like about the team, make an appointment, app feed, etc. It's well done but also really confusing at the same time. I don't really know what I am looking at for most of the time. It has a lot of colors but they flow well. The main colors are white and a purplish blue color. Each section has their own color as well.I think it matches their product and auidence well. They color works and is not over powering. The website has quotes and lots of moving images. The boxes are square with sharp corners and the font is a simple clean font in white. When you stay on an image for a while, the image gets closer. A lot of the writing is in all capital letters. Some of the information is boring and is underneath the images but on top of it too. I like the brands logo its a cool triangle thing.</p>

	<p>I really like this website. It is so pretty and chique and I just love it. It is very interactive anso simple but beautiful. This website is a lot more chill than the last website. This one is interacte and beautiful and not crazy and cool like the last one. The code is in HTML. It has lots of divs, lists, attributes, a head, a body, a nav, a footer, etc. There is some Chinese or Japanese on some of the elements, so that is cool. I don't see any tables. The layout makes sense but is a lot. The code is super long and laid out so it is easy to read and try to make sense of what is going on. There is a scrolling effect and its cool and not too much. It is the perfect amount and makes the website that much better. It is really easy to navigate. It has tabs and you can click on the images. The colors are very clean and work together really well. There is lots of white space and white is the main color. The colors are like green, brown, black, grey, and hints of other bright colors. It defienately matches the audience of people photographers or designers of houses and furniture. When you hover over an image it becomes grey with the title of the product and who it is buy. Also when you go on the tab, each title of another page gets crossed out if you are hovering over it. The pictures are all different sizes, but the all match up perfectly. All the images are rectabgles and squares. Most of the pictures are either square or curvy and they go well together. The text is very chique and bold and capital letters.</p>
	
	<h2>Bad!</h2>
	
	<a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/" title="Yale School of Art">Yale School of Art</a>
	<p>This website is a nighmare and I don't understand why Yale,an ivy league school, would have a website like this. The background is a gif of a dog riding on a tortouse and it keeps repeating over and over again. This website is very random and just looks bad. There are random colored boxes everywhere and the colors do not match, but the fonts look the same. I don't see any tables, but they are using html. I recognize some stuff, but they also have some weird still like meta, rect, svg, polygon, etc. This website seems very cluttered, much like the code. I get where its coming from, but it is all over the place and not very easy to read. The layout kind of makes sense with the body, head, footer, etc. but there is a lot going on to where its hard to find things. The website is really easy to navigate. It has been done really well surprisingly. The main page is very confusing, but once you explore the website, it is really easy to get. Yes, their is a scrolling effect. The content moves, but the background does not. There are no main colors. Each section of the website is a different color and they dont go together. The boxes are all squares or rectangles with sharp edges. They have lots of ads for their school and upcoming events. The text formatting once you look around is bad and the text is all black, but the background of it is all colored different things. There is no white space. Everything is moving or has color. There are lots of cool icons, but this website has a lot and is a lot to look at. This website just looks messy and I think that is what they were trying to do because it is an art school and messy things can be concidred art. </p>
