<h2>b-town is a land of plenty. it's got north-western heart and activty galore. the moutains are your idaho playground. most cars have ski, kayak or bike racks because people are all about being a part of their environment. boise is comfortable, yet always advancing into the big city it might one day be. boise people are welcome to each new cultural event or downtown festival that brings us a little closer to metropolitan-life. in driving outside the central area, one finds a peaceful country existence juxtaposed with newly developed subdivisions. it retains farming community charm while presenting the good and bad that comes with growth. boise is perfect-move here. you will be happy.</h2>
